# OrderSelector
It is called Player Selector on Google Play.
Order Selector is a compact mobile application that I worked on in my free time. My brother asked me to make it since there was not an app where he could easly make the starting order of the players playing in a board game.

The app has four functionalities the first one orders the players, the second one chooses the first player, the third is a coin flip, while the last one is a cube roll.
The first 2 work by each player placing one of their fingers on the screen. After 3 seconds elapse the starting player will be choosen or the order will be determined.
